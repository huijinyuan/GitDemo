I met the my supervisor in city center today. We have talked the life in last 9 years.
He has introduced a training school which may teach Python language and promise to get a job after studying.
I will consider trying it.

The training may take 3 month. It is located in Helsinki. How much it costs? Where I should live? So many open questions.
